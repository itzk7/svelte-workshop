## Prerequisite learning
Try to finish the Part 1 and Part 3 of the learning source https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte

I have created one simple app using svelte, playaround with it to learn about store, event dispatching and property bindings
https://svelte.dev/repl/b42abb120dcc482e8c34fbcb14a5cad8?version=4.2.7

## Workshop structure
**NOTE: The main file contains all the code necessary to complete the application. Please refer to the main file for the solution**

There are four branches: activity-1, activity-2, activity-3, and activity-4.

In each branch, you can find instructions for the corresponding activity in the Readme section.

First, git checkout to the activity-1 branch. You can find the activity todo as part of activity-1. If you finish it, then move on to activity-2, then activity-3, and so on.

Once you finish activity-4, you will have completed the fully functional expense tracker app.
