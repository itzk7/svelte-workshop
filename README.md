# Svelte workshop
In this workshop, We will learn svelte by building one expense app,

#### Run
```bash
npm i
npm run dev -- --open
```
The expense app is now accessible in the browser. The complete solution is available in the main branch code. To complete this workshop, follow the workshop structure given below

## Workshop structure
**NOTE: The main branch contains all the code necessary to complete the application. Please refer to the main file for the solution**

There are four branches: activity-1, activity-2, activity-3, and activity-4.

In each branch, you can find instructions for the corresponding activity in the Readme section.

First, git checkout to the activity-1 branch. You can find the activity todo as part of activity-1 at ```Readme.md```. If you finish it, then move on to activity-2, then activity-3, and so on.

Once you finish activity-4, you will have completed the fully functional expense tracker app.
